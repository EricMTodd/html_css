## The Seven Real-World Steps to a Fully Functional Website

### 1. Define your project

Define the goal of your project
Define your audience
Design with both of these in mind.

### 2. Plan Out Everything

Plan your content: text, images, videos, icons, etc.
Start thinking about visual hierarchy
Define the navigation
Define the site structure if it's a bigger project

### 3. Sketch Your Ideas Before You Design

Get inspired and think about your design
Get the ideas out of your head: sketch your ideas before you start designing
Make as many sketches as you want, but don't worry about making it perfect
Never start designing without having an idea of what you want to build
